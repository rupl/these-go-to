# Eleventy Starterkit

There are many 11ty starterkits. This one is mine.

- Eleventy v2
- WebC all the things!
- Default layout: `page`
- CSS bundle outputs within `<head>`
- JS bundle defaults to bottom of `<body>`, but you can opt-in specific components to `<head>` bundle.
- Installable by default: PWA provided by minimal SW/manifest files. You provide the icons.
